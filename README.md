# Exploratory-data-analysis-and-prediction-of-chronic-kidney-disease
In this project, I focused to analyze and visualize the dataset using python language to understand what the data looks like, show the relationship between the data, and choose the best way to clean the dataset. Also, i applied a different machine learning algorithm to predict the test data set.

# Description of dataset
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal disease. Chronic kidney disease involves conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy.You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage.Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse.The Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset consists of 25 features and one target variable.

# RESULTS
In this study, 26 data recording information of 355 people such as age, blood pressure, specific_gravity, blood_urea, and others were used as attributes. Clinical records were examined to determine whether chronic kidney disease was present or not, and provided a high accuracy rate with machine learning methods.

In the study, three different classifiers were utilized in determining the targeted chronic kidney disease and the best performing classifier was tried to be found. These algorithms were compared on the basis of accuracy, sensitivity, sensitivity, recall, and f1 score. When the results were evaluated with the data used in this study, it was seen that the RandomForestClassifier method performed better than other classification algorithms.

Machine learning tools can be used for timely and accurate diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, helping doctors confirm their diagnostic findings in a relatively short time, thereby helping a doctor to look and diagnose more patients in less time. In future studies, it may be possible to use different algorithms, such as deep learning methods, to predict chronic kidney disease.
